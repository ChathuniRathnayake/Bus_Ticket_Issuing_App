# 🚌 REAL TIME BUS TICKET ISSUING AND SEAT AVAILABILITY SYSTEM

## 📌 Project Overview

The Real Time Bus Ticket Issuing and Seat Availability System is a smart digital solution designed to modernize highway bus ticketing. The system consists of:

- 📱 Mobile Application (Passengers & Conductors)

- 🌐 Web Application (Admins & Passengers)

The platform enables conductors to issue tickets digitally using seat selection, while passengers can book tickets online and view real-time seat availability — including seats that will become available at intermediate stops.

The system ensures real-time synchronization, prevents double-booking, and improves efficiency using Firebase-powered updates.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

Current highway bus ticketing systems rely on manual or partially digital processes, leading to:

- Seat tracking difficulties at intermediate stops

- Passenger confusion about seat availability

- Slow ticket issuing during peak hours

- No real-time synchronization

- Risk of double-booking

A comprehensive real-time solution is required to improve efficiency, transparency, and passenger experience.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Digital ticket issuing via seat selection

- Online passenger booking

- Real-time seat availability updates

- Display seats that will become free at upcoming stops

- Prevent double booking

- Provide user-friendly mobile and web interfaces

- Maintain reliable real-time backend synchronization
